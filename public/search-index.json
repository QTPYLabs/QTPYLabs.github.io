[{"content":"I made my first hand wash today. This is first time I am working with surfactants.\nI was concerned it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t turn out well because I added a bit more guar gum than I had initially planned. The guar gum had just arrived today, and I had seen so many videos on formulating with guar. So, my excitement got the better of me😅.\nThis was one of the few formulations where I went in without a lot of planning. I used a combination of anionic and amphoteric surfactants. I am quite happy with the foam—it turned out much better than expected.\nThe only prior planning I did was that I calculated the active surfactant matter (ASM) of the final formulation. Everything else was more or less a guess. I also wanted to include a small quantity of a carrier oil (to make it milder) and a fragrance oil. I wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure how to go about this, so I used a solublizer. I added the pre-mixed oils and solubilizer phase as the final step. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if it was the right choice, but so far, so good. If you have any suggestions on how to improve this process, please let me know.\nAll my ingredients were purchased from Purenso Global and Art Connect\n","date":"2024-03-15","id":0,"permalink":"/blog/my-first-hand-wash/","summary":"Story about my first hand wash by working with surfactants.","tags":[],"title":"My First Hand Wash 🧴"},{"content":"","date":"2024-03-15","id":1,"permalink":"/blog/","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"The Formulator's Notebook 👩‍🔬"},{"content":"Anhydrous body butter has been a tempting DIY project for me, and I\u0026rsquo;ve dived into the challenge since the day I started my home lab. Yet, my attempts have been a train of failures, and the main reason is the scorching environment I call home.\nI have tried many cooling techniques - \u0026ldquo;freezer olympics\u0026rdquo; - where I race from my lab to the freezer after every 2 minutes of whipping and many others. Despite my best efforts, the body butters always collapse after a few minutes at room temperature - just like my dreams of a beautiful, whipped body butter.🥲\nHot processing hasn\u0026rsquo;t worked for me yet, as shown in the first image. The second one was cold processed with 79% (the majority of which is cocoa butter) of butters, which, even though a bit soft, was still better than the first one.\nI also added some kaolin clay to offset the greasiness.\nMy next move is to try hot processing again, this time with a higher butter percentage, and incorporating beeswax and thickeners for added stability.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;ve conquered the art of body butter in hot and humid climates, drop your tips in the comments below.\nIngredients from: Purenso Global and The Art Connect\n","date":"2024-01-13","id":2,"permalink":"/blog/anhydrous-body-butter/","summary":"Playing with Anhydrous body butter.","tags":[],"title":"Anhydrous body butter 🍯"},{"content":"Today, I decided to experiment with Xanthan Gum by making a gel with it. So, in the first attempt, I added all the Xanthan Gum into a mixture of glycerin and water at once. Well, it turned into a clumpy party! The gel ended up uneven, and I had to spend a good chunk of my time trying to break up those clumps and even out the texture.😮‍💨\nRound two: Took it slow, added the Xanthan Gum bit by bit into the glycerin, stirred it, let it sit for a while, and then introduced it to the water.\nVoila! 🪄 The gel was so much smoother and evenly thick. Also, the mixing part was such a breeze compared to round one.\nNote to self and fellow gel enthusiasts: Gradually incorporating Xanthan Gum into glycerin before water can lead to a smoother and more evenly textured gel. It can also make the mixing process so much easier!\n","date":"2024-01-10","id":3,"permalink":"/blog/experiment-with-xanthan-gum/","summary":"Learning Xanthan Gum Mixture. .","tags":[],"title":"Experiment with Xanthan Gum ✨ "},{"content":"","date":"2023-09-07","id":4,"permalink":"/docs/guides/","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Guides"},{"content":"Coming Soon\u0026hellip; ","date":"2023-09-07","id":5,"permalink":"/docs/guides/introduction-to-cosmetics/","summary":"Coming Soon\u0026hellip; ","tags":[],"title":"Introduction to Cosmetics 🧪"},{"content":"","date":"2023-09-07","id":6,"permalink":"/docs/reference/","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Reference"},{"content":"","date":"2023-09-07","id":7,"permalink":"/docs/","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Docs"},{"content":"","date":"2024-03-15","id":8,"permalink":"/contributors/","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Contributors"},{"content":"","date":"2024-03-15","id":9,"permalink":"/contributors/nawal-abdul-kareem/","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Nawal Abdul Kareem"},{"content":"","date":"2024-03-14","id":10,"permalink":"/privacy/","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Privacy Policy"},{"content":"","date":"2024-03-14","id":11,"permalink":"/","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Welcome to QTPY Labs 🧪"},{"content":"\rRead about reference in the Diátaxis framework ","date":"0001-01-01","id":12,"permalink":"/docs/reference/","summary":"\rRead about reference in the Diátaxis framework ","tags":[],"title":""},{"content":"","date":"0001-01-01","id":13,"permalink":"/categories/","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Categories"},{"content":"","date":"0001-01-01","id":14,"permalink":"/tags/","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Tags"}]
