Anhydrous body butter has been a tempting DIY project for me, and I've dived into the challenge since the day I started my home lab. Yet, my attempts have been a train of failures, and the main reason is the scorching environment I call home.

I have tried many cooling techniques - "freezer olympics" - where I race from my lab to the freezer after every 2 minutes of whipping and many others. Despite my best efforts, the body butters always collapse after a few minutes at room temperature - just like my dreams of a beautiful, whipped body butter.ü•≤

Hot processing hasn't worked for me yet, as shown in the first image. The second one was cold processed with 79% (the majority of which is cocoa butter) of butters, which, even though a bit soft, was still better than the first one.

I also added some kaolin clay to offset the greasiness.

My next move is to try hot processing again, this time with a higher butter percentage, and incorporating beeswax and thickeners for added stability.
